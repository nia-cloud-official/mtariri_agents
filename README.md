# Mtariri Agents Database Connection

## Description
This project is a simple PHP script that establishes a connection to a MySQL database named `mtariri_agents` on a local server. The database credentials are hardcoded in the script for simplicity.

## Usage
The script attempts to establish a connection to the database and prints an error message if the connection fails. If the connection is successful, you can use the `$conn` object to interact with the database using PHP's MySQLi functions.
